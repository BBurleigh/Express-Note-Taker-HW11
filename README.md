# Express-Note-Taker-HW11

## Description
Aside from this being a HW assignment, the goal was to practice connecting the back-end to the front-end code (the latter of which was provided to us). The task was to be able to write and save notes to a db.json file as well as delete those notes.

## Installation
In order to run this on your terminal, you will need to type the command "npm i" in order to run this app from your terminal.  By extent, express is needed by running this command as well as node_modules.

## Usage
I have attached several screenshots to display its appearance and functionality:

## Contributions
Aside from myself and research, my tutor and two of support staff at AskBCS Learning (on Slack) immensely helped me by bouncing ideas off of each other and finding areas where the code could be fixed/tweaked/added/removed.
